### Description

The primary focus of visualizing data for Alaska Airline is to illustrate how multiple attributes of Alaska
Airlines differ from each other and by what amount. For instance, how much does arrival delay and departure vary over the course of weekdays.

As a team of 5 people we worked on creating a network visualization to realize the air traffic where the Alaska airlines operates it's flights, compared Arrival & Departure delay for different airports operated by Alaska airlines, identified competitor airline based on the passenger traffic and the number of flights, compared the performance of the Alaska airlines with its competitor based on various metrics like delay, cause of delay,.etc based on visualizations.
